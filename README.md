# Kat-Nguyen-Portfolio

## Description:

My portfolio features a brief description about me, recent projects and ways to get in contact. I have also linked my github and linkedin on the navigation bar, and a downloadable pdf of my resume in the 'about me' section for convenience. 

Projects that I have included mention the technologies used, a brief description of its purpose and links to the repo and deployed website.

The first project features a one page personal website for a musician that includes the most important information, like his social media handles, future tour dates and a way to contact him.

The second project is a daily planner application to help users stay organized and features color coded time blocks to better see past, present and future activities. 

The third application is a password generator to provide better security, enabling the user to choose criterias they want in their password and the application will generate a random password.
